Hello

What to open:
Start by one of the following:
tab1.html   - Standings
tab2.html   - Standings comparison
tab3.html   - Coefficient
There are hyperlinks between each tab.

What to use:
Google Chrome
(Mozilla Firefox won't display our cool tooltips, or should I say... cooltips)

Preferences:
height: any, but it would look better over 700px
width: over 1366
a 1920x1080 screen makes it look less cluttered
